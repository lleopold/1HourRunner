Troubleshooting:

If the prefabs are pink when you open the demo scene, this means that URP Package is not installed or configured correctly.

If you have the following error message: the type or namespace name universal does not exist ...
This means that URP Package is not installed.
If you do not have URP installed, other error messages may appear in the console. Install URP to make console errors disappear.
